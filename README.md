# Titanic Survival Prediction  

This repository focuses on predicting Titanic passenger survival using **Orange** and **Python**. The goal is to identify the best algorithms for accurate predictions while developing a comprehensive report using **Typst**.  

## Current Status  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, and class.  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Orange**: For visual workflows and data exploration.  
  - **Python**: For detailed analysis and model implementation.  
- **Completed Work**:  
  - Data preprocessing and exploration.  
  - Implemented and tested the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm in both Orange and Python.  

## Work in Progress  
- Experimenting with additional algorithms such as Logistic Regression and K-Means Clustering.  
- Evaluating and comparing model performances across Orange and Python.  
- Drafting a detailed report with **Typst** to document findings and results.  

## Future Plans  
- Optimize model parameters to improve performance.  
- Add visualizations and detailed performance metrics.  
- Complete and finalize the report with insights and conclusions.
